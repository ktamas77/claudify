# claudemesh

**Let your local [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) sessions find and talk to each other — in realtime, with zero compromises to the Claude Code CLI you already use.**

Run `claude` in three folders. Today they don't know the others exist. Install claudemesh and they do: each session gets a stable ID, can list its peers, send them tasks that wake them up the instant they arrive, and read each other's conversation history — all over a tiny localhost daemon. No cloud, no network exposure, no auth, no behavior changes inside `claude` itself. Stop using it any time and the original `claude` binary is exactly as it was.

```bash
claudemesh          # launch claude inside the realtime supervisor
claudemesh -c       # claude -c (continue most recent session)
claudemesh --resume # any other claude flag works the same
```

Anything that isn't a recognized subcommand (`list`, `send`, `install`, …) is forwarded straight to the wrapped `claude` binary, so `claudemesh` is a drop-in alternative entrypoint to `claude` — no alias, no shadow, no plugin install inside Claude. You get every feature of Claude Code (sessions, hooks, plugins, MCP, sub-agents, slash commands, IDE integration) plus the inter-instance side channel.

> Status: v0.2 — realtime PTY supervisor + folder-name addressing + idle tracking.

## Why

You probably run `claude` in several folders at once. They have no idea about each other. Claudemesh gives every session a stable identity and a realtime side channel:

- **Find peers**: list which other Claudes are running on this machine, where, and for how long.
- **Hand off work**: `claudemesh send api-service "rerun the migration check"` — the recipient wakes up and acts on it within a second if it was launched via `claudemesh`, or on its next user prompt otherwise.
- **Inspect**: peek at another instance's history (recent turns, search, fetch a specific turn) when you need cross-session context.
- **Notice**: the receiver's status line ticks up (`✉2`) when messages are waiting.

Everything is purely additive. Hooks and MCP are installed at the user level (`~/.claude/`), so existing project-level Claude Code config is untouched. Removing claudemesh is one command (`claudemesh uninstall`) and leaves no trace inside `claude` itself.

## How it works

There are two layers, and you can use either independently:

```
   ┌─────────────── one machine ───────────────┐
   │                                            │
   │  ┌── claudemesh (PTY supervisor) ────────┐   │  ← Layer 2: realtime injection
   │  │   ↑↓ proxy user terminal ↔ claude  │   │      (when launched via `claudemesh`)
   │  │   subscribes to daemon /events      │   │
   │  │   writes "[inbox]\n" to PTY master  │   │
   │  └─┬─────────────────────────────────┬─┘   │
   │    │ (PTY pair)                      │     │
   │  ┌─▼──────────────── claude ──────────▼─┐  │  ← Layer 1: hooks + MCP
   │  │   SessionStart/End hooks             │  │      (works with bare `claude` too)
   │  │   UserPromptSubmit hook (drains inbox)│ │
   │  │   Stop hook (blocks on tasks)        │  │
   │  │   MCP server: claudemesh               │  │
   │  └──────────────────────────────────────┘  │
   │                                            │
   │              ┌─────────────────────────┐   │
   │              │  claudemesh daemon        │   │
   │              │  HTTP @ 127.0.0.1:7878  │   │
   │              │  • registry + idle flag │   │
   │              │  • inboxes              │   │
   │              │  • events long-poll     │   │
   │              │  • liveness sweep       │   │
   │              └─────────────────────────┘   │
   └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

The daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` only. State persists to `~/.claudemesh/`.

### Realtime via the supervisor

`claudemesh` spawns `claude` inside a PTY (via `node-pty`) and proxies your terminal byte-for-byte to/from it — so it looks and feels exactly like running `claude` directly. Any flag you pass to `claudemesh` (e.g. `claudemesh -c`, `claudemesh --resume <id>`) is forwarded to claude. In parallel the supervisor long-polls the daemon for new inbox messages addressed to this session. When one arrives:

1. Wait for the daemon's `idle` flag on this session to be `true` (the `Stop` hook sets it when claude finishes a turn; the `UserPromptSubmit` hook clears it).
2. Wait for ≥500ms of stdin silence (so we don't corrupt typing).
3. Write `[inbox]\n` to the PTY master.

That sentinel is read by claude as if you typed it. `UserPromptSubmit` fires, the hook drains the inbox, and the messages arrive as additional context attached to that turn — with explicit instructions to _act_ on `kind="task"` bodies, not just acknowledge them. End-to-end latency from `send` to claude starting work is sub-second on a healthy machine.

### Without the supervisor (bare `claude`)

If you keep running `claude` directly, the inbox + hooks still do most of the work:

- Messages still queue in the inbox.
- Status line still shows `✉N`.
- The `Stop` hook still blocks on pending tasks if it happens to fire while messages are queued.
- `UserPromptSubmit` still drains messages into the next turn.

What you lose is the **wake-up for fully-idle claude**: messages that arrive after `Stop` has already fired sit in the inbox until you submit any prompt. With the supervisor, that gap goes away.

### Status line

```
[abc12345 · 3 peers · ✉2]
```

- `abc12345` — this session's ID.
- `3 peers` — count of _other_ live Claudes (drops out at zero).
- `✉2` — unread inbox messages (drops out at zero).

## Install

> Requires Node ≥ 20. The supervisor needs `node-pty` (native, prebuilt for darwin/linux/win).

```bash
npm i -g @ktamas77/claudemesh
claudemesh install
```

`claudemesh install` patches two files (each backed up first):

- `~/.claude/settings.json` — adds the four hooks and the status-line script.
- `~/.claude.json` — adds the `claudemesh` MCP server under `mcpServers`.

After this, just use `claudemesh` everywhere you'd type `claude`:

```bash
claudemesh              # interactive session in the supervisor
claudemesh -c           # resume the most recent session
claudemesh --resume xyz # resume a specific session id
```

The original `claude` binary is untouched — both work side by side. Use `claudemesh` when you want realtime inbox delivery; use `claude` when you don't (you still get the inbox + ✉ status line, just no auto-wake).

If you'd rather invoke the supervisor under a shorter name, drop a tiny script anywhere on your PATH:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.local/bin
cat > ~/.local/bin/clc <<'EOF'
#!/bin/sh
exec claudemesh "$@"
EOF
chmod +x ~/.local/bin/clc
```

Now `clc -c` is `claudemesh -c` is `claude -c`-with-supervisor.

```bash
claudemesh uninstall   # reverses the install
```

If `node-pty` fails to install (older toolchain), bare `claudemesh` errors out with a fix-it message but the subcommands (`claudemesh list`, `claudemesh send`, etc.) still work.

### Adding the badge to an existing status line

If you already have a custom `statusLine` script in `~/.claude/settings.json`, `claudemesh install` detects it and **leaves it alone** rather than clobbering your customizations. To add the `[abc12345 · 3 peers · ✉2]` badge yourself, capture stdin once and pipe it to `claudemesh statusline`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
input=$(cat)

# ... your existing parts ...
out="$host | $model | $ctx | $folder"

# Claudemesh badge (only renders if claudemesh is installed and a session is registered)
if command -v claudemesh >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  badge=$(printf '%s' "$input" | claudemesh statusline 2>/dev/null)
  [ -n "$badge" ] && out="$out | $badge"
fi

printf '%s\n' "$out"
```

`claudemesh statusline` reads the same JSON Claude Code already pipes to your script (it needs `session_id`), prints `[id · peers · ✉N]`, and exits silently with no output if the daemon is down or the session isn't registered yet.

## CLI

```
claudemesh [claude args...]              launch claude inside the realtime supervisor
                                       (e.g. `claudemesh -c`, `claudemesh --resume <id>`)
claudemesh list                          show all live Claude sessions
claudemesh whoami                        this shell's parent claude (best-effort by ppid)
claudemesh send <target> <message>       send a task message; target = id or folder name
claudemesh history <target> [-n N]       tail another session's transcript
claudemesh search <target> <query>       search another session's transcript
claudemesh status                        daemon health + instance count
claudemesh install / uninstall           patch / unpatch ~/.claude config
claudemesh help                          show subcommand help
claudemesh run [claude args...]          explicit form of the default supervisor launch
claudemesh daemon / mcp / hook / statusline   internal (used by Claude Code)
```

Anything that's not a recognized subcommand from this list is treated as args for the supervisor and forwarded to claude — that's how `claudemesh -c` and friends work.

`CLAUDEMESH_CLAUDE_BIN` overrides which binary the supervisor launches (default: `claude` on PATH). Useful if you have multiple Claude Code builds installed.

### Addressing sessions: id or folder name

Anywhere a target is expected — CLI commands and MCP tools alike — you can pass either the 8-char `claude_id` or the **basename of that session's working directory**. The resolver:

1. Tries an exact `claude_id` match against the live registry.
2. Falls back to a case-insensitive match on `basename(cwd)`.

```bash
# These two are equivalent when one live session is running in /Users/me/dev/api-service
claudemesh send 7k3p9q2x "rerun the migration check"
claudemesh send api-service "rerun the migration check"
```

If the folder name matches more than one live session (e.g. `~/orgA/api` and `~/orgB/api` both running), the resolver errors out with both `claude_id`s and full paths so you can disambiguate by id. If nothing matches, it prints all live sessions.

## MCP tools

The `claudemesh` MCP server exposes the following inside every `claude` session. Wherever a tool takes a target session, you can pass either an 8-char `claude_id` or a folder basename (see [Addressing sessions](#addressing-sessions-id-or-folder-name)).

| Tool                                       | Purpose                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `whoami`                                   | Your own `claude_id`, cwd, started_at.                                                                                                            |
| `list_instances`                           | All live sessions: id, cwd, last_active, pending count, idle.                                                                                     |
| `send_message(to, body, kind?)`            | Send to another session. `kind: "task"` (default) wakes the recipient via the supervisor / Stop hook; `kind: "note"` is silent until next prompt. |
| `read_inbox(drain?)`                       | Pull pending messages for the current session (defaults to draining).                                                                             |
| `read_history(id, last_n_turns?, redact?)` | Recent turns from another session, redacted by default; pass `redact: false` for raw.                                                             |
| `search_history(id, query, options?)`      | Substring/regex search over another session's transcript with surrounding context.                                                                |
| `get_turn(id, turn_index)`                 | Pinpoint full-content fetch of one turn after `read_history` / `search_history` flagged it.                                                       |

## Message delivery

Two kinds:

- **task** (default) — receiver acts on the body as if you typed it. Three delivery paths, in priority order:
  1. **Supervisor injection (realtime)** — if the receiver was launched via `claudemesh`, the supervisor writes `[inbox]\n` into the PTY the moment the message arrives and the receiver is idle + not actively typing. Sub-second wake-up.
  2. **Stop hook (between turns)** — if the receiver is _just finishing_ a turn when the message lands, the `Stop` hook blocks the stop and feeds the message in as the continuation directive.
  3. **UserPromptSubmit (next prompt)** — if neither of the above caught it (bare `claude`, fully idle), the message sits in the inbox until the user submits any prompt to that receiver, at which point it's appended as additional context for that turn.
- **note** — surfaces only via path #3 (next prompt). Doesn't block stops, doesn't wake the model.

Inbox is at-least-once and drained on read.

### Idle tracking

The daemon stores an `idle: boolean` per session, kept in sync by the hooks:

- `SessionStart` (or first register) → `idle: false`
- `UserPromptSubmit` (user just submitted) → `idle: false`
- `Stop`, when allowing the stop (no inbox tasks pending) → `idle: true`

The supervisor reads this flag before injecting, ensuring it never types into a session that's mid-turn.

## Privacy & security

- Daemon binds to `127.0.0.1` only — never `0.0.0.0`. Single-user assumption matches the rest of `~/.claude`.
- `read_history` redacts large tool results / file contents above a per-line byte cap by default. Pass `redact: false` (or use `get_turn`) for raw.
- Hooks fail open: any daemon error is logged and the hook exits 0. Claude Code keeps working with no claudemesh integration if the daemon is down.
- The supervisor never writes to the PTY without (a) idle flag set and (b) ≥500ms stdin silence — so it can't corrupt input you're typing.

## Development

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ktamas77/claudemesh.git
cd claudemesh
npm install
npm run build       # tsc → dist/ (also chmod +x the bin)
npm run dev         # tsc --watch
npm run lint        # eslint
npm run format      # prettier --write
npm run typecheck   # tsc --noEmit
npm test            # vitest run
```

Pre-commit (husky) runs `typecheck → test → lint-staged`. A broken type or failing test blocks the commit.

## Roadmap

- [x] Architecture & repo scaffold (TS + ESLint + Prettier + Husky)
- [x] Phase 1 — daemon + register/list + status line
- [x] Phase 2 — MCP tools (`whoami`, `list_instances`, `send_message`, `read_inbox`)
- [x] Phase 3 — task-mode wake-up, `read_history` / `search_history` / `get_turn`
- [x] Phase 4 — liveness sweep + lazy daemon autostart
- [x] Phase 5 — folder-name addressing, sharper imperative inbox prompts
- [x] Phase 6 — `claudemesh` PTY supervisor for realtime injection (with subcommand passthrough)
- [ ] Real-world soak across many concurrent supervisor sessions
- [ ] Reply chains: auto-set `from` when a recipient calls `send_message` after waking
- [ ] Optional desktop notification fallback for un-supervised idle sessions
- [ ] Inject the message body itself instead of an `[inbox]` sentinel (bracketed paste for multi-line; prepend `from <id> · ` for attribution; preserve existing path as fallback when paste mode unavailable)
